E-commerce Clothing app simulating Shopify sites 

Clothing Website - Similar to Zumeiz, Pacsun, Addidas, etc
Description: Create a E-commerce website that emulates the popular websites clothing websites such as Zumiez, PacSun, Addidas etc. This full stack application is my way of understanding creating full-stack application development with a microservice architecture. While this may be a overdeveloped approach, this seems like a fun experiment to test this approach

[Design Mockup](https://excalidraw.com/#json=nS-rcVpBQ91Ho2CtscRvr,kWY9T3jDc3Fn0wvYblrSBg)

# Goals:
- Create microservice architecture with four simple services that interact and communicate with one another through data streams such as Apache Kafka
	- User, Product, Order, Cart
- Frontend - experiment more with TailwindCSS
	- Auth
		- Sign-in
		- Sign-out
		- Salting techniques
	- Pages
		- User
			- Cache locally with Cookies
			- Info about user and order history
		- Cart
			- Cache cart for quick lookup
		- Order
			- Pre-Complete
			- Complete
			- History
		- Product
			- Information
			- Ratings
	- Searching
- Work with the StripeAPI to simulate purchases
- **Stretch GOALS**
	- Recommendation system
